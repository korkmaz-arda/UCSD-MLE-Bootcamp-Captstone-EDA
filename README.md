# Capstone Project: Data Wrangling and EDA

## Overview
This repository contains the data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) for our Machine Learning Engineering Bootcamp Capstone project. We have performed EDA on two datasets: Food101 and UECFoodPixComplete, as well as a dataset we created ourselves.

## Repository Structure
- `EDA_Food101.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing EDA for the Food101 dataset.
- `EDA_UECFoodPixComplete.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing EDA for the UECFoodPixComplete dataset.
- `tray-track/`: Directory containing the scripts for creating and wrangling the TrayTrack dataset.

## Explored & Wrangled Datasets
- **Food101**: A dataset with 101 food categories, each containing 1,000 images.
- **UECFoodPixComplete**: A comprehensive dataset for food images.
- **TrayTrack**: The TrayTrack Dataset consists of 1,854 images specifically designed for tracking food trays. The dataset includes images with annotations for tray locations in COCO 1.0 format. Augmentation techniques, including geometric transformations (rotation, flipping, cropping, etc.) and color transformations (color jittering, grayscaling, brightness/contrast adjustments, etc.), were applied to increase size and variability.
